        <!-- <h1>The Golden Age</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          The superhero always defeats the villain. Clear stylistic distinction
          between good and evil.
          <br />
          Basic sequential images (close to comic strips in newspapers) and
          straightforward stories.
          <br />The cartooning was simple. <br />Basic square grid, often more
          text than images

        <h1>The Silver Age</h1>
        <br />
        <p>
          Historic events (f.e. World War II) called for a change in
          storytelling. Publishers explored other genres such as horror.
          <br />
          Visual styles mimed the themes.
          <br />
          An era of artistic experimentation and political supression started as
          a result of the CCA censorship.
          <br />
          Cover images became an artistic represantation of an issues
          theme/protoganist's state of mind.
          <br />
          Took inspiration from past art movements such as Surrealism.

        <p>
          CCA censorship ends after the release of a spiderman comic with a drug
          topic. <br />
          The comics dealt with realistic stories/stories of urban life that had
          no real answer to them.
          <br />
          Photorealistic depictions of the urban landscape.
          <br />Alter ego of superheroes and everyday people get in the focus.
          <br />Depth of focus and lighting, gave comics a cinematic style.

        <br />
        <p>
          Characters were psychological comples, often dangerously. The line
          between hero and villain disappeared. <br />
          The style get darker and plays with lightig, long shadows and deep
          dark contrasting colors. <br />The night was the main setting. <br />
          Took inspiration from noir film and the silver age in sense of
          unnatural angles and disturbing imagery.

          Can't be catogorized.
          <br />
          Advanced technologies has led to a broad range of illustrative
          techniques (3D modelling, digital painting etc.) Some stories are even
          adapted to motion comics.
          <br />
          Styles vary drastically depending on nature of the story and choices
          of the creator.
          <br />Line between film and comics is thin.
